    "\n",
    "\"\"\"In a linear equation, the terms \"dependent variable\" and \"independent variable\" refer to different types \n",
    "   of variables that are used to represent relationships between quantities. Here's the difference:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Independent Variable:\n",
    "      The independent variable, often denoted as \"x,\" is the variable that you can control or manipulate in \n",
    "      an experiment or a mathematical model. It's the variable that is considered the cause or input in the \n",
    "      relationship. In the context of a linear equation, the independent variable is the one you put into the\n",
    "      equation to observe its effect on the dependent variable. For example, in the equation y = mx + b, where\n",
    "      y is the dependent variable and x is the independent variable, you can control and change the value of\n",
    "      x to see how it affects the value of y.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Dependent Variable:\n",
    "      The dependent variable, often denoted as \"y,\" is the variable that you're interested in studying or\n",

    "      in the independent variable. In the context of a linear equation, the dependent variable is the one\n",

    "      + b, y is the dependent variable, and its value depends on the value of x.\n",
    "\n",
    "  In summary, the independent variable is the input or the cause, and the dependent variable is the output \n",

    "   unreliable coefficient estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Multicollinearity can manifest in a few different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Perfect Multicollinearity: This occurs when two or more independent variables are perfectly correlated,\n",
    "      meaning that their relationship can be expressed by a constant multiple of each other. This creates an \n",
    "      issue because the linear regression algorithm cannot distinguish the unique effect of each variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "   Multicollinearity can lead to the following issues:\n",

    "     absence of multicollinearity becoming insignificant.\n",
    "\n",

    "     a smaller coefficient (or even the opposite sign) when other correlated variables are included.\n",

    "#11. What is heteroskedasticity, and what does it mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Heteroskedasticity is a term used in statistics to describe a situation where the variability of the\n",
    "   residuals (the differences between observed and predicted values) in a regression model is not constant \n",
    "   across all levels of the independent variable(s). In other words, the spread or dispersion of the\n",
    "   residuals changes as the values of the independent variable(s) change. This phenomenon is also known \n",
    "   as non-constant variance of errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Heteroskedasticity can be visually identified when the scatterplot of the residuals shows a fan-like or \n",
    "   funnel-like pattern, indicating that the spread of residuals increases or decreases systematically with\n",
    "   changes in the independent variable(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "   Heteroskedasticity can lead to several issues in regression analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Inefficient Coefficient Estimates: When heteroskedasticity is present, the standard errors of the \n",
    "      coefficient estimates can become biased and inefficient. This can lead to inaccurate hypothesis \n",
    "      testing and confidence interval estimation for the regression coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Incorrect Inference: Heteroskedasticity can result in incorrect conclusions about the statistical \n",
    "      significance of the predictors. Coefficients that might not actually be significant can appear \n",
    "      significant due to biased standard errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. Unreliable Hypothesis Tests: Hypothesis tests like the t-test and F-test assume constant variance of\n",
    "      errors. In the presence of heteroskedasticity, these tests might not be reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "   4. Model Fit: Heteroskedasticity indicates that the model does not adequately capture the underlying \n",
    "      patterns in the data. This can affect the overall fit and predictive power of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "   To detect and address heteroskedasticity:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Residual Plot: Create a scatterplot of the residuals against the predicted values. If you see a pattern \n",
    "      where the spread of residuals changes with the predicted values, it's an indication of heteroskedasticity.\n",

    "   Addressing heteroskedasticity depends on its severity and the underlying cause. Some techniques to handle\n",
    "   heteroskedasticity include:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Weighted Least Squares (WLS): Giving more weight to observations with smaller residuals can help account \n",

    "\n",
    "   - Transformations: Applying transformations to the dependent or independent variables can sometimes stabilize\n",
    "     the variance.\n",

    "\n",
    "   2. Bias-Variance Trade-off: By adding a penalty to the coefficients, ridge regression increases bias \n",
